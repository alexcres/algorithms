Ax=b

2 1 7 21 a 71
3 4 8 34 b 84
4 3 3 43 c 33
         d

71     2     1
84 = a 3 + b 4 ...
33     4     3

a    0      10
b =  1  + x 1
c    10     0
d    0      -1

X = Xp + N
solutions = solution + null_space(N)
NA = 0
0 + solution = solution
just like in (x, y) vector
e.g. y - 2x = 1
x = 1 + x 1
y   3     2
NA: think of it as a plane perpendicular to another plane
    A cuts N at any point is a solution
