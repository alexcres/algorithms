Key: division is inaccurate
Philosophy: y/x can solve them all, substitute it with cross operation, which can solve them all.
            if one way can solve them all, there is another way to solve them all.

Convex Combination
AB, AC, what is AD(D is a point between line BC)?
// prove using vector arithmetics
AD = a * AB + (1-a) * AC

Cross Product
AB: (Xb - Xa, Yb - Ya)
AC: (Xc - Xa, Yc - Ya)
AB X AC = (Xb - Xa) * (Yc - Ya) - (Xc - Xa) * (Yb - Ya)

Direction
clockwise if cross is positive

Turn Direction
AB, BC
AB X AC, positive means turn right

Intersection
Direction
OnSegment
