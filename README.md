# Algorithms

## Project overview

This project is mainly to learn id structures and algorithms (using the book 
"Introduction to Algorithms" by CLRS), and to practice C++.

Pseudo code is nice, but I don't have anyone to check the correctness beside myself.
I am using code for that, just like using a calculator to check math.

Tried Python. Didn't like it. Everything in Python is dictionary.

Tried Java. Quite liked it. C++ is more readable cause header files and has pointer concept.

Tried Rust. Terrible for id structures.

C++ cause it can go low and high level.

Focus on prove-of-concept, not about vigorous error handling and corner cases.

Only stacks are using template programming. First time learning c++, just want to try
it out. Other code doesn't, to keep things simple.

## Dependency

Dev dependency: `googletest`, installed in system.

Tools: `cmake`.

## How to use

Everything is in `src`.

Test:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./algorithms_tests

# or just use an IDE with cmake integration
```
